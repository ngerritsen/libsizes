Show the sizes of your favorite libs and calculate the proximate size of your libs combined. Note that I do not assure a precisely correct and up to date library size. The minifying and compression type can also influence the size, as well as the bundling of files. I am willing to accept pull requests for new libraries or updated sizes.
